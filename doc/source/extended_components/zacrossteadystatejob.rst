ZacrosSteadyStateJob
--------------------

.. currentmodule:: scm.pyzacros.core.ZacrosSteadyStateJob

``ZacrosSteadyStateJob`` class represents a job that is a container for other jobs, called children jobs, which must be :ref:`ZacrosJobs <zacrosjob>` or :ref:`ZacrosSteadyStateJob <zacrossteadystatejob>` kind objects. This class is an extension of the PLAMS MultiJob class. So it inherits all its powerful features, e.g., being executed locally or submitted to some external queueing system transparently or executing jobs in parallel with a predefined dependency structure. See all configure possibilities on the PLAMS MultiJob class documentation in this link: `PLAMS.MultiJob <../../plams/components/jobs.html#multijobs>`_.

The ``ZacrosSteadyStateJob`` class constructor requires a Settings object to set the parameters for the Steady-State calculation. The rest of the parameters related to the Zacros calculation ( e.g., lattice, mechanism, and the cluster expansion Hamiltonian ) are provided indirectly through a reference job ``reference`` from which the calculation ``Settings`` is taken to be replicated through its children. Children are initially copies of the reference job. However, just before they are run, their corresponding Settings are altered accordingly to the rules defined through a ``Parameters`` object provided in the constructor. In particular, this ``Parameters`` object should be specially tailored to modify the Zacros parameters that control Zacrosâ€™s behavior in terminating and resuming a simulation, namely ``max_steps``, ``max_time``, or ``wall_time``. Please consult Zacros' user guide (``$AMSHOME/scripting/scm/pyzacros/doc/ZacrosManual.pdf``; the section "Setting up a KMC Simulation in Zacros"->"Command-Line Arguments") for more details about the specific meaning of these keywords.

This class handles three aspects:
  1) Convergence of the calculation until steady-state conditions are reached by assessing the turnover frequencies of gas species at various times.
  2) Parallel execution of replicas (different random seeds) to achieve faster convergence on the turnover frequencies by increasing the efficiency in the sampling process at the cost of more computational power.
  3) Automatic scaling of the kinetic constants (if requested by the user) in the event that processes occurring in the reaction mechanisms have very different time scales

In summary, the steady-state calculation proceeds as follows: The calculation is run for a short period of time (specified by the user). The calculation is then post-processed to extract the number of occurrences of each elementary step, allowing the quasi-equilibrated events to be identified and scaled. According to the specified time by the "Parameters" object, the simulation is divided into an ensemble of contiguous batches. Each batch is only executed if the previous batch has not converged (has not reached the steady state). To determine convergence, the turnover frequencies are estimated at the end of the given batch (or average values if parallel replicas are requested), and the steady-state behavior of the simulation is evaluated based on the  turnover-frequencies confidence intervals. A calculation is deemed complete, and no additional batches are calculated if it converges for a particular batch.

The following lines illustrates how to use this class:

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

  ss_sett = pz.Settings()
  ss_sett.turnover_frequency.nbatch = 20
  ss_sett.turnover_frequency.confidence = 0.96
  ss_sett.nreplicas = 2

  params = pz.ZacrosSteadyStateJob.Parameters()
  params.add( 'max_time', 'restart.max_time', numpy.arange(20.0, 100.0, 20.0) )
  print(params)

  ss_job = pz.ZacrosSteadyStateJob( settings=ss_sett, reference=z_job, parameters=params )
  results = ss_job.run()

Lines 6-7 demonstrate how to use the ``Parameters`` object.
The object is created by invoking its constructor (line 6). Then we added an independent variable called ``max time``, which ranges from 20.0 to 100.0 in 20.0 increments. The size of the batches is determined by this ``max time`` parameter or array. Line 8 displays the parameter's final values.
Finally, lines 10 and 11 construct the ``ZacrosSteadyStateJob`` object and call its method ``run()`` to execute it.

When running the ``ZacrosSteadyStateJob`` calculation (see :meth:`~ZacrosSteadyStateJob.run` method), all necessary input files for zacros are generated in the job directory (see option ``name`` in the constructor), and Zacros is internally executed. Then, all output files generated by Zacros are stored for future reference in the same directory. The information contained in the output files can be easily accessed by using the class ``ZacrosSteadyStateResults``.

Each batch (or iteration) is executed in a new job directory,
``plamsjob/plamsjob_ss_iter000``, ``plamsjob/plamsjob_ss_iter001``, etc. In case of replicas, the sufix ``_repXXX`` is added to the job directories, i.e., ``plamsjob/plamsjob_ss_iter000_rep000``, ``plamsjob/plamsjob_ss_iter000_rep001``, etc. All output files are generated and stored for future reference. The ``plams_job`` prefix can be replaced by using the option ``name`` in the constructor. Notice the status of each job follows the sequence ``STARTED-->RUNNING-->FINISHED-->SUCCESSFUL``.

As a final comment, be aware that ``ZacrosParametersScanJob`` can be used in combination with ``ZacrosSteadyStateJob``; to do that, just use the latter one as a reference for the former one.

The following lines illustrates how to do so:

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

  # Steady-State calculation
  ss_sett = pz.Settings()
  ss_sett.turnover_frequency.nbatch = 20
  ss_sett.turnover_frequency.confidence = 0.96
  ss_sett.nreplicas = 2

  ss_params = pz.ZacrosSteadyStateJob.Parameters()
  ss_params.add( 'max_time', 'restart.max_time', numpy.arange(20.0, 100.0, 20.0) )

  ss_job = pz.ZacrosSteadyStateJob( settings=ss_sett, reference=z_job, parameters=ss_params )

  # Parameters scan calculation
  ps_params = pz.ZacrosParametersScanJob.Parameters()
  ps_parameters.add( 'x_CO', 'molar_fraction.CO', numpy.arange(0.1, 1.0, 0.1) )
  ps_params.add( 'x_O2', 'molar_fraction.O2', lambda params: 1.0-params['x_CO'] )

  ps_job = pz.ZacrosParametersScanJob( reference=ss_job, parameters=ps_params )
  results = ps_job.run()
