Predefined Models
=================

Use the following classes to easily access popular model systems; they load all parameters for models like the Ziff-Gulari-Barshad that we used frequently in the examples above. In this approach, each time you use pyZacros for model systems, you won't have to fill in all the species, clusters, and reactions.
