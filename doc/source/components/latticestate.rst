LatticeState
------------

A significant result from a KMC simulation is how the different sites in the lattice are populated as a function of time.
During a Zacros simulation, Zacros takes snapshots of the lattice state and writes them in the file ``history_output.txt``.
Parallelly pyZacros stores each snapshot as a ``LatticeState`` object (see ZacrosResults) for further analysis and/or use
on the python side. Another important application of LatticeState objects is that they can be used as initial states, either
as objects from a previous simulation or built from scratch.

For our example (see :ref:`use case system <use_case_model_zgb>`), we will use the ``LatticeState`` class to build a
lattice state from scratch, and use it as the initial state.

.. note::

    pyZacros (as Zacros does), by default, will start with an empty lattice if not stated otherwise.

We are going to make the initial state as a randomly populated lattice by ``CO*`` and ``O*`` with a given coverage:

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

   # LatticeState setup (initial state)
   ist = pz.LatticeState(lat, surface_species=spl.surface_species())
   ist.fill_sites_random(site_name='StTp1', species='CO*', coverage=0.1)
   ist.fill_sites_random(site_name='StTp1', species='O*', coverage=0.1)

   print(ist)

   ist.plot()

Similarly to the other classes, the function ``print()`` (see line 6) allows taking a look at the Zacros code that
will be internally generated, which for this example is the following:

.. code-block:: none

      initial_state
        # species * CO* O*
        # species_numbers
        #   - CO*  12
        #   - O*  11
        seed_on_sites CO* 1
        seed_on_sites CO* 4
        seed_on_sites O* 6
        seed_on_sites O* 10
        seed_on_sites O* 20
        seed_on_sites CO* 30
        seed_on_sites CO* 43
        seed_on_sites O* 48
        seed_on_sites O* 52
        seed_on_sites CO* 55
        seed_on_sites O* 58
        seed_on_sites CO* 62
        seed_on_sites CO* 69
        seed_on_sites CO* 70
        seed_on_sites O* 72
        seed_on_sites CO* 73
        seed_on_sites CO* 78
        seed_on_sites CO* 93
        seed_on_sites O* 99
        seed_on_sites O* 106
        seed_on_sites O* 109
        seed_on_sites O* 110
        seed_on_sites CO* 115
      end_initial_state

Please consult Zacros' user guide for more details about the specific meaning of the keywords used in the previous lines.

Finally, to visualize the lattice you can make use of the function ``plot()`` (see line 8). The result is as follows:

.. image:: ../../images/lattice_initial_state.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :align: center

.. note::

    To visualize the previous figure, be sure you have `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ installed.
