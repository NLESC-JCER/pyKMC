***************

Warning code 4008 from mechanism_parser_module: this mechanism contains irreversible steps. DANGER: IRREVERSIBLE STEPS VIOLATE MICROSCOPIC REVERSIBILITY!
Moreover, for such steps, Zacros treats the Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relation as a purely mathematical relation and does not take any action if [activation energy] < max([reaction energy],0). 
Use irreversible steps in mechanism_input.dat with caution, if you really know what you are doing!

More information: 
The following steps are irreversible:
    1 : CO_adsorption
    2 : O2_adsorption
    3 : CO_oxidation

***************

***************

Warning code 4009 from mechanism_parser_module: a cached activation energy for an irreversible event is out of the physically meaningful range: [activation energy] >= max(0,[reaction energy]). Check your Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relation parameters (activation energy at zero coverage and proximity factor) or define the step as reversible, so that appropriate filtering is applied automatically.

More information: 
Activation energy out of physically meaningful bounds for elementary step 3: CO_oxidation.
Ea = 0.0000000000000000, DErxn = 1.2629999999999995.
