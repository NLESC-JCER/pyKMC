    "The scale disparity issue is common in Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. It emerges\n",
    "as a result of the fact that some fundamental events or groups of them typically\n",
    "occur at vastly different time scales; in other words, their rate constants can\n",
    "span multiple orders of magnitude. In heterogeneous catalysis, there are typically\n",
    "two groups: 1) very fast events that correspond to the species' surface diffusions\n",
    "and 2) slow reactions that change their chemical identity. The latter group of events\n",
    "is usually the one of interest because it allows the evaluation of the material's\n",
    "catalytic activity. In contrast, the species' surface diffusion does not contribute\n",
    "significantly to the net evolution of the slow reactions. But, as becomes the most\n",
    "frequent step, it also becomes the limiting factor of the simulation progress,\n",
    "considerably increasing the computational cost. This tutorial shows how to speed up\n",
